# 🛠️ IT Helpdesk Automation with AI | Intelligent Ticket Classification & Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Overview

Traditional IT helpdesk systems rely heavily on **manual ticket handling** and **rule-based workflows**, often resulting in:

* ❌ Incorrect ticket classification
* ⏳ Delayed response times
* 📈 Higher operational workload

To solve these challenges, this project introduces an **AI-powered, adaptive, and automation-driven IT Helpdesk System** that integrates **Artificial Intelligence + Agile principles** to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

---

## 🎯 Objective

👉 To modernize IT Helpdesk operations by building a **self-learning system** that can:

* Automatically classify IT support tickets
* Detect unusual ticket trends (anomalies)
* Continuously retrain and improve performance
* Enhance service efficiency and user satisfaction

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✔ **AI-Based Ticket Classification**

* Uses **fine-tuned BERT & RoBERTa models**
* Understands contextual ticket text
* Classifies into categories like:

  * 🔌 Network Issues
  * 💻 Software Problems
  * 🖥️ Hardware Faults
  * 🛡️ Security Issues

✔ **Anomaly Detection Module**

* Continuously monitors ticket trends
* Detects unusual spikes or abnormal patterns
* Triggers proactive alerts to IT admins

✔ **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**

* Displays ticket flow
* Classification stats
* Model performance
* System health metrics

✔ **Agile-Based Continuous Improvement**

* Supports incremental model updates
* Continuous learning pipeline
* Handles evolving ticket patterns

## 🧩 System Architecture

1️⃣ User submits IT ticket (text)
2️⃣ NLP engine processes & understands context
3️⃣ AI model classifies ticket into correct category
4️⃣ Anomaly detector checks unusual patterns
5️⃣ System updates dashboard + sends alerts if needed
6️⃣ Continuous retraining ensures adaptability

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

✔ Improved ticket classification accuracy
✔ Reduced response time
✔ Automated helpdesk workflow
✔ Better resource utilization
✔ Real-time intelligence & adaptability


```
